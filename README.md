1. **Create a Google Cloud Platform Project:**
   - Go to the Google Cloud Console: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing project.

2. **Enable the Google Drive API:**

   - Provide a name for your OAuth 2.0 client ID.
   - Add the following redirect URIs:
     - `https://your-worker-subdomain.your-subdomain.workers.dev/_oauth`
     - `https://your-worker-subdomain.your-subdomain.workers.dev/oauth2callback`
     Replace `your-worker-subdomain` and `your-subdomain` with your actual Cloudflare Worker subdomain and domain.
   - Click "Create" to generate your OAuth 2.0 client ID and client secret.

4. **Obtain the Refresh Token:**
   - Use the [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground) to obtain the refresh token.

   - Once authorized, exchange the authorization code for tokens.
   - The refresh token will be included in the response. Make sure to note it down.

5. **Use the Credentials in Your Cloudflare Worker:**
   - Store the client ID, client secret, and refresh token securely as environment variables or secrets in your Cloudflare Worker.


## Deploying `worker.js` from GitHub to Cloudflare Worker with Free Plan
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Make sure you have a Cloudflare account. If not, sign up at [https://www.cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com).

3. **Create a Cloudflare Worker:**
   - Log in to your Cloudflare account.
   - Go to the "Workers" section from the Cloudflare dashboard.
   - Click the "Create a Worker" button.

3. **Configure GitHub Repository:**
   - Fork the repository "Serverless-Temp-File-Sharing" on [Yuukio Fuyu Github Page](https://github.com/YuukioFuyu/Serverless-Temp-File-Sharing).
   - Go to your forked repository.
   - Navigate to the `worker.js` file in the repository.

4. **Modify the Script:**
   - Open the `worker.js` file in your forked repository.
   - Make any necessary configuration changes or adjustments as needed for your deployment.
   - Edit this object in the script with the details you generated above.
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: "",
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: "",
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN: "",
DESTINATION_FOLDER_ID: "",
```
> The Destination Folder ID can be found at the back of the Google Drive URL when you open one of your folders.
> Example: `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/`[YOUR_DESTINATION_FOLDER_ID]

5. **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
   - Copy the content of the `worker.js` file in your forked repository.

7. **Create a New Cloudflare Worker:**
   - Go back to your Cloudflare Workers dashboard.
   - In the "Script" section, paste the content of the `worker.js` file.

7. **Deploy and Test:**
   - Click the "Save and Deploy" button to deploy the worker.
   - Once the deployment is successful, you'll receive a worker URL.

8. **Configure Routes:**
   - To route incoming requests to your Cloudflare Worker, configure the routes.
   - Go to the "Routes" section in the Cloudflare Workers dashboard.
   - Add a new route (e.g., `https://your-subdomain.your-domain.com/*`) and associate it with the deployed worker.

9. **Testing:**
    - Access the URL of your worker (e.g., `https://your-subdomain.your-domain.com/`) to test the deployed script.
